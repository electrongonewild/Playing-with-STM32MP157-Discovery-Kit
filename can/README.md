# CAN Communication
CAN  stands for Controller Area network. It is an Asynchronous serial communication protocol introduced in 1986 by Robert Bosch.
CAN protocol is a message based protocol not address based means transmitted data is available for all nodes and its receiver’s choice to receive data or not.<br>
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for CAN communication
* Flash autorun CAN config files on startup
* Use ```SocketCAN```  module to send and receive CAN frames using can-utils
* Send and receive CAN frames using ```python-can```

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here are direct links for same.<br>
* [Datasheet](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) 
## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of CAN communication(it's never too late you can checkout this [Link](https://embedclogic.com/can-protocol/))  
## Connections
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Implementation
* <b>Changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for CAN communication</b><br>
   The hardware for this port is m_can1 whose pins are PIN3-FD_CAN1TX(PA12), PIN5-FD_CAN1RX(PA11)<br>
   All M_CAN nodes are described in stm32mp153.dtsi file with disabled status, change the status “disabled” to “okay” as shown below:<br><br>
   ```
   m_can1: can@4400e000 {
     compatible = "bosch,m_can";                       
     reg = <0x4400e000 0x400>, <0x44011000 0x1400>;   
     reg-names = "m_can", "message_ram";
     interrupts = <GIC_SPI 19 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
              <GIC_SPI 21 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
     interrupt-names = "int0", "int1";
     clocks = <&rcc CK_HSE>, <&rcc FDCAN_K>;
     clock-names = "hclk", "cclk";
     bosch,mram-cfg = <0x0 0 0 32 0 0 2 2>;
     status = "okay";
   };
 
 Build .dtbs, Push the devicetree into the board.<br>
 Make sure to connect an external CAN transceiver circuit for communicating over a CAN bus.
