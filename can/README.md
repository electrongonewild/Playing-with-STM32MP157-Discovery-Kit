# CAN Communication
CAN  stands for Controller Area network. It is an Asynchronous serial communication protocol introduced in 1986 by Robert Bosch.
CAN protocol is a message based protocol not address based means transmitted data is available for all nodes and its receiverâ€™s choice to receive data or not.<br>
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for CAN communication
* Flash autorun CAN config files on startup
* Use ```SocketCAN```  module to send and receive CAN frames using can-utils
* Send and receive CAN frames using ```python-can```
