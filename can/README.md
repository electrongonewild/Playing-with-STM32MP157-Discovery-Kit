# CAN Communication
CAN  stands for Controller Area network. It is an Asynchronous serial communication protocol introduced in 1986 by Robert Bosch.
CAN protocol is a message based protocol not address based means transmitted data is available for all nodes and its receiverâ€™s choice to receive data or not.
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for CAN communication
* Flash autorun CAN config files on startup
* Use ```SocketCAN```  module to send and receive CAN frames using can-utils
* Send and receive CAN frames using python-can

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here are direct links for same.<br>
* [Datasheet](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) 
* [AT Command Manual](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip)
## Prerequisites
* [Realterm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/index.html#downloads_Download) or any other serial terminal
* USB to TTL (CP2102)
* EC200 EVB
* Jumpers
* Basic knowledge of UART and serial communication
## Connections
![Alt text](Images/Schematic_EC200_2022-04-21.png?raw=true "Title")
* Rx(EC200) ---> Tx(USB to TTL)
* Tx(EC200) ---> Rx(USB to TTL)
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Connect the USB to TTL(CP2102) to USB port of PC and open device manager to check the port connected to serial bridge (USB to TTL).<br>
![Alt text](Images/deviceManager.png?raw=true "Title")
* Open Realterm or any other serial terminal you want to use.
* Open the port to which your serial device is connected make sure to check serial configuration as follows:<br>
   Baudrate : 115200<br>
   Data Bits : 8<br>
   Parity : None<br>
   Stopbits : 1<br>

* That's it!!! Now you can send AT commands using realterm directly to GSM Module and also receive its response.
* Firstly check whether you receive ```OK``` in response to ```AT\r\n```, to make sure that your connections and configurations are fine.
* Now you can further proceed to other AT commands according to your application.
## Basic AT Commands
1. Basic AT Command: ```AT\r\n```
2. Deactivate PDP Context: ```AT+QIDEACT=1\r\n```
3. Set APN: (according to network operator)
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"JIONET","","",0\r\n``` for JIO SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"airtelgprs.com","","",0\r\n``` for Airtel SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"portalnmms","","",0\r\n``` for Vodafone SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"bsnlnet","","",0\r\n``` for Airtel SIM
4. Activate PDP Context: ```AT+QIACT=1\r\n``` 
5. Ping Google to check internet availability: ```AT+QPING=1,"www.google.com"\r\n```
