# UART Protocol
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a dedicated hardware associated with serial communication. UART is used in many applications like GPS Receivers, Bluetooth Modules, GSM and GPRS Modems, Wireless Communication Systems, RFID based applications etc.<br>
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for UART communication
* Send and receive data via UART using ```serial``` library in python

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of UART communication(it's never too late you can checkout this [Link])  
## Connections
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Now you can further proceed according to your application.
