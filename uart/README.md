# UART Protocol
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure fdcan pins for UART communication
* Send and receive data via UART using ```serial``` library in python 

## Table of Contents
* [Documentation](/uart/README.md#documentation)
* [Prerequisites](/uart/README.md#prerequisites)
* [Connection Diagram](/uart/README.md#connections)
* [Getting Started](/uart/README.md#getting-started)
* [Implementation](/uart/README.md#implementation)
* [Contributions](/uart/README.md#contributions)

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here are direct links for same.<br>
* [Datasheet](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) 
## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of UART communication(it's never too late you can checkout this [Link])  
## Connections
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Now you can further proceed according to your application.
