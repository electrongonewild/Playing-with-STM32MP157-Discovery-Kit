# UART Protocol
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a dedicated hardware associated with serial communication. UART is used in many applications like GPS Receivers, Bluetooth Modules, GSM and GPRS Modems, Wireless Communication Systems, RFID based applications etc.<br>
In this project, we are going to see the following using STM32MP157x-DK1/2:
* Make changes to device tree to configure pins for UART communication
* Send and receive data via UART using ```serial``` library in python

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of UART communication
## Connections
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Now you can further proceed according to your application.
## Implementation
* Changes in device tree to configure uart pins for UART communication.<br>
Working directory: STM32MPU_workspace/STM32MP15-Ecosystem-v2.0.0/Developer-Package/stm32mp1-openstlinux-5.10-dunfell-mp1-21-11-17/sources/arm-ostl-linux-gnueabi/linux-stm32mp-5.10.61-stm32mp-r2-r0/linux-5.10.61/arch/arm/boot/dts . <br>
Open stm32mp157a-dk1.dts and add the following lines
```
&usart3 {
    pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
    pinctrl-0 = <&usart3_pins_b>;
    pinctrl-1 = <&usart3_sleep_pins_b>;
    status = "okay";
};
```
* Open file stm32mp15xx-dkx
* These configurations are for pins ```PB10(USART3_TX)``` and ```PB12(USART3_RX)``` on GPIO connector
